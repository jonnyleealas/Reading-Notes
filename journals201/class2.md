### Html Text
  Html is a text document that uses tags known as markup. Tags look like this <></> . There are many kinds of tags that do different things. For example: < head > </ head > is used in a website to give the website information and commands that are hidden behind the scenes. < b > **is a tag that makes words bold.**

  ### CSS
  Css is what gives html style and color. It helps make a website more intersting by adding things like color, font styles, and background color.
  #
  It's good practice to use ccs outside of your html page to keep things organized. You would add a < link > in the head of the html to let it know where to look for css. Adding a link can also help with multiple web pages of a cite. Using a link in the head of the html page will tag changes throughout the pages simultaneously. Some developers use multiple css sheets to organize their work. **Ex**: One css for coloring and another css sheet for layout. This is something that I may use once I get more comfortable using css!

  ### Javascript
  This is complicated and after reading through the chapters I still don't know much. However, I'll try.
  Java script gives browsers instructions for html and css, in a language that the browser understands. It uses variables and expressions similar to algebra to communicate certain tasks. It can combine if and else statements with variables to communicate.
   >If this happens do this. Else(if this doesn't happens) do this. 
   #
   It will read the the commands from top to bottom. 
   # 
   **Ex:**
   1. this command.
   1. then this command.
   1. and this command.
   1. else
   1. do this command.
   # Operators
   I need to engrave these in my brain, because they are a bit confusing at the moment.

**Ex:**
- && :
This compares two things to be true.
- == : This compares whether something is equal. 
- || : This compares two things whether one is true or one is false.

   Javascript is the language that make websites interactive. It brings things to life. It let's you ask a question and will return a value we can read on the page.
